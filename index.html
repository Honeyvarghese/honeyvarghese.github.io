      <p>Self-organization is a process where some form of overall order or coordination arises out of the local interactions between smaller component parts of an initially disordered system.

   And there is a certain type of energy flow that has self-organized into life.  Each cell within our bodies is a self-organized mass of swirling energy that maintains itself using a natural form of intelligence known as animate intelligence.  And each one of those billions of cells connects with others, to form organs, blood flow, a nervous system, and all the other miraculous complexities that coalesce to make you and me into the mind/body organism known as a human being.</p>

<p>Multi-cellular models that facilitates the self organization of initial random distribution of cells to regular cellular networks can be very useful in the ﬁeld of bio-engineering and medical applications. These models incorporate a set of parameters that represent the physical and chemical properties of the biological system.These parameters are used to deﬁne the components of the models that when simulated reproduce the behavior of the biological system. 
Challenge is to find the parameter space that provide the </p>

Genetic Algorithm can be used to search for those parameters that contribute to the self organization capability of the system. Set Complexity Algorithm is used for the measuring the regularity of the resulting cellular pattern to determine the ﬁtness of the parameters set derived by the Genetic Algorithm. </p>

The system developed will be capable of 
---Generating random cell patterns
---Analyzing and measuring the "interestingness and regularity using Set Complexity Algorithm.
---Making changes in the previous state so as to generate better useful patterns
---Continuing  the process to arrive at a state(cell pattern) that is forms a regular pattern.

Thus system will accure an interesting property of biological system- Self Organization.</p>
