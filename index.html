<p>Multicellular models that facilitates the self organization of initial random distribution of cells to regular cellular networks can be very useful in the ﬁeld of bioengineering and medical applications. These models incorporate a set of parameters that represent the physical and chemical properties of the biological system.These parameters are used to deﬁne the components of the models that when simulated reproduce the behavior of the biological system. Genetic Algorithm can be used to search for those parameters that contribute to the self organization capability of the system. Set Complexity Algorithm is used for the measuring the regularity of the resulting cellular pattern to determine the ﬁtness of the parameters set derived by the Genetic Algorithm. 
The system developed will be capable of 
*Generation random cell patterns
*Analyzing and measuring the "interestingness and regularity
*Making changes in the previous state so as to generate better useful patterns
*Continuing  the process to arrive at a state(cell pattern) that is best.
-&gt;&gt; I found this interesting because of its possible applications in medical and bio-engineering fields. Also, I am excited to build a simulator capable of automatically generating  the naturally existing cellular pattern </p>
