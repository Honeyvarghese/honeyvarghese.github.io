Each cell within our bodies is a self-organized mass of swirling energy that maintains itself using a natural form of intelligence known as animate intelligence.  And each one of those billions of cells connects with others, to form organs, blood flow, a nervous system, and all the other miraculous complexities that coalesce to make you and me into the mind/body organism known as a human being.\r\n\r\nMulti-cellular models that facilitates the self organization of initial random distribution of cells to regular cellular networks can be very useful in the ﬁeld of bio-engineering and medical applications. These models incorporate a set of parameters that represent the physical and chemical properties of the biological system.These parameters are used to deﬁne the components of the models that when simulated reproduce the behavior of the biological system. \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15885993/11381590/1d16e60c-92ba-11e5-87c5-c63a111752b6.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe challenge here is to find the parameter values that can help in modelling the self organization. Genetic Algorithm is used to search the parameter space. \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15885993/11382350/87ff5162-92be-11e5-90ea-7b2b00e3f99f.png)\r\n\r\nThe different parameters of the cells are represented as genes in the Genetic Algorithm.
