{"name":"Automated Modelling of Self-Organization  in Artiﬁcial Tissue Simulators using Genetic Algorithm.","tagline":"Honey Varghese, Intelligent Systems Project","body":"Self-organization is a process where some form of overall order or coordination arises out of the local interactions between smaller component parts of an initially disordered system.\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15885993/11380976/8936e9da-92b6-11e5-9b1f-c653cb380ea7.jpg) \r\n\r\nAnd there is a certain type of energy flow that has self-organized into life.  Each cell within our bodies is a self-organized mass of swirling energy that maintains itself using a natural form of intelligence known as animate intelligence.  And each one of those billions of cells connects with others, to form organs, blood flow, a nervous system, and all the other miraculous complexities that coalesce to make you and me into the mind/body organism known as a human being.\r\n\r\nMulti-cellular models that facilitates the self organization of initial random distribution of cells to regular cellular networks can be very useful in the ﬁeld of bio-engineering and medical applications. These models incorporate a set of parameters that represent the physical and chemical properties of the biological system.These parameters are used to deﬁne the components of the models that when simulated reproduce the behavior of the biological system. \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15885993/11381590/1d16e60c-92ba-11e5-87c5-c63a111752b6.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe challenge here is to find the parameter values that can help in modelling the self organization. Genetic Algorithm is used to search the parameter space. \r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15885993/11382350/87ff5162-92be-11e5-90ea-7b2b00e3f99f.png)\r\n\r\nGenetic Algorithms uses the evolution theory to evolve the fittest chromosomes. Here we express the parameter values of the system as genes. The fittest chromosome is the one with genes representing the parameter values that give the best result.Thus the simulation of system with those parameters will result in the self organisation of the cells.\r\n\r\nHere the interesting part is the analysis of the result to determine the best chromosome. In other words we need to determine weather the random cells are self organized. Idea here is to find the Set Complexity of the images produced by the simulation of cells using those parameter values. The better organised cell patterns will have better Set Complexity.\r\n\r\nSee the below graph which represents  the change in Set Complexity as the system proceeds from a random state to an organised form\r\n\r\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15885993/11384214/4132c6e4-92cb-11e5-87f3-9203c6a52f4c.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
