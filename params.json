These models incorporate a set of parameters that represent the physical and chemical properties of the biological system.These parameters are used to deﬁne the components of the models that when simulated reproduce the behavior of the biological system. Genetic Algorithm can be used to search for those parameters that contribute to the self organization capability of the system. Set Complexity Algorithm is used for the measuring the regularity of the resulting cellular pattern to determine the ﬁtness of the parameters set derived by the Genetic Algorithm. \r\nThe system developed will be capable of \r\n---Generating random cell patterns\r\n---Analyzing and measuring the \"interestingness and regularity using Set Complexity Algorithm.\r\n---Making changes in the previous state so as to generate better useful patterns\r\n---Continuing  the process to arrive at a state(cell pattern) that is forms a regular pattern.\r\n\r\nThus system will accure an interesting property of biological system- Self Organization.\r\n \r\n![setcomplexity](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15885993/11379822/bfd58714-92af-11e5-9426-d9d2b3316624.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
